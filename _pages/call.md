## Submission Details

We encourage researchers to submit their latest work on the intersection of learning method, control and dynamical system.

*   **Formatting Instructions**: The submitted paper sould take the form of `TBD`. The maximum size of submission is 50MB. The submission is allowed to attach a supplement/appendix but the reviewers do not have responsibility for reviewing supplementary material.
*   **Reviews**: The review process will be double-blind. All submission must be anonymized and the leakage of **any** identification information is prohibited.
